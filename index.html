	<h2 class = two>The Growth of The Sidemen</h2>
	</center>
		With the growth of social media in the last decade or so, many successful careers have been produced by it. The Sidemen are 
		a perfect example of this. The Sidemen, originally The Ultimate Sidemen, started as seven different individual channels, each of the 
		members' personal channels in 2013. The group consists of KSI, W2S, Miniminter, Behinzga, TBJZL, Vikkstar123, and ZerkkaHD.
		They mostly posted GTA, football(soccer), and FIFA videos in their early career. They started building popularity from their collaborations
		with each other	and soon some of them moved into a house together known as the Sidemen House. Additionally,
		in 2014, they started their own clothing company called Sidemen Clothing. Then in 2016 they decided to 
		create a joint channel which would be called The Sidemen. Each member of the group shouted out the group channel
		to grow its popularity(subscribers). In three days after the launch of the channel, The Sidemen YouTube channel gained over
		a million subscribers which at the time was the fastest channel to hit this milestone. They started making more moves
		in football and making videos together, but the real boost in popularity came during their disstrack season.
		Their disstracks, posted on their individual channels, propelled them into a wider audience when at the time they were entangled
		with popular American YouTubers. Later, it was revealed and confirmed to be fake disses, but the popularity gained from
		the events did not dissipate. Then in 2018, the Sidemen revealed they will be starting Sidemen Sundays, which is where every week
		they post a video on Sunday. This gained them millions upon millions of viewers. Sidemen Sundays still go on and many look
		out for them every Sunday. Now with over 18 million subscribers and insane growth with their clothing company, they have been able
		to collab with brands and sports teams such as Arsenal FC and newest one Hot Wheels. Additionally, they hold big
		events like a charity football match where it is Sidemen FC vs. YouTube Allstars. Last year their football match got over 2 million 
		concurrent views on the live stream which is extremely hard to do. Not only do the Sidemen have their own clothing brand
		, but they also have their own food business, vodka, and podcasting app (along with three other active collaborative YouTube channels). 
		Their brand names are Sides, XIX Vodka, and Side+. From all of this and still running their individual channels they are millionaires.
		They have many more achievements both together and individually that any other YouTube group or YouTuber can only dream of having.
		They are an example of true organic growth to stardom that came from the rise of social media.
